### How Flutter Works
1. The Flutter Code runs on engines created in **`C/C++`**.
2. The Flutter Engine does not request rendering from the host OS.
3. All UI and animations run on the engine.
4. However, host OS widgets and animations are not available because all widgets and animations run on the engine.
5. So any iOS or Android type widgets provided by Flutter is fake.
### Flutter vs React Native
1. If you want a customized UI and design for everything, use Flutter.
2. If you want to follow the UI and widget of the host OS, use React Native.
